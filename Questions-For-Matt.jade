//- Questions for Matt
--- 5/17/14 Call  

1. In the album.scss did I anwser the question on Margin Vs. Padding correctly, and if not, why? 

2. See Jade Mixin's ( Album.jade/ln 38 ) If I wanted to throw a javascript variable in here (for a random time lets say), 
	would I insert the javascript under a .script tag the header, and then how to call that variable in code from Jade? 

3. Album View: See if the way I made the text float right was a good method, or was I putting a bandaid on another issue? 

4. I used an !important tag on _album_collection to remove the top border, and on the thumbnail to remove backgroundf and border, 
   was this correct? 

5.Take a look at Json Editor for future use. 

6. Ask about Git terminal commit issues (http://onetoshare.com/5gLP). Also, related : Pushing to git push origin master doesnt seem to work, 
but pushing to git push github master does. 

7. Issue with getting Jquery to work with current checkpoint.

1. General : In JS, when setting a property, when to use sing quotes ('') and when to use doubles ("")? (Reference: http://onetoshare.com/i8VO)

2. OST : Look at photos.js, function addImage ( line 61 ) and discuss (e) parameter, and e.target. Lets discuss event delegation. 

3. General : Difference between document.querySelector and .querySelectorAll ( lets say for a class of .test)

4. Album.js line 63 : $songList.empty();  - does this clear the $songList element if there is anything in it? 

5. Album.js Line 96 : Take a peek at the click handler I built to handle the play button roll over, and see about buggyness. (When you roll over .songRow it replaces itself with itself, because of my use of $previous?... ideas on how to avoid this? 

6. OST : Look at Current Ajax Work and comment on.

# Checkpoints Done (but not submitted due to account freeze):  
##446 : I understand most of this from my training to date. Didnt play with REPL a ton, also there are checkpoint documentation issues here that make the setup of this hard. Repo shoubd be created before you are asked to run REPL in the directory that doesnt exist. Contacted Bloc Support. 
##447 : This should be 446, and 446 should be 447. Mocha Runs ok for me : http://onetoshare.com/Mx9l
##448 : Done and Comitted, but see question 3 below. Having trouble editing these files in Sublime. 
##449 : Done and Committed. Still curious where the property values are coming from ;). 




# Questions : 

##450 & 451 (JS Exercises w/Mocha Tests) : Got stuck here on the way these mocha tests are set up. Don't feel they explain well enough how the test sar e being run to understand how to solve them. Often one test would pass and others would fail. Also, see # 3 below.   

1. See about fixing git-osxkeychain issues ( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#password-caching ) Screenshot : http://onetoshare.com/jJt6

2. Pushing to Heroku issues. 

3. Strange issue with Javascript challenges. Files in terminal not matching files on system. Ended up using VIM editor to modify spec.js to fix issue. For example, I created a new folder on finder and it doesnt show in terminal - whats causing this? 
	
    Also, a question about this function in challenge.js - where are the 'text' and 'address' property values coming from ( who is passing them to this function )  ? 

4. Enjoy using VIM vs Sublime - seems faster - thoughts? Realize it's personal preference, but are there downsides to VIM?
